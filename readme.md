# Micro üÜô
A microservice that checks whether a website is up or not.

## Usage
By default, availability information is sent using plaintext, e.g.

```
GET https://up.now.sh/google.com
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

google.com is up.
```

### Using JSON

You can override the default (plaintext) by appending `?json` to the end of the URL, eg - `http://up.now.sh/google.com?json`.

```
GET https://up.now.sh/google.com?json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{"url":"google.com","status":"Up"}
```
